# Tailwind CSS Best Practices

## Project Setup

- Ensure Tailwind config is properly set up and pruned
- Configure theme extension, spacing, breakpoints, and plugins
- Keep a consistent color palette driven by design tokens

## Design Tokens & Colors

- Use semantic color tokens from `src/styles/theme.css`
- Never hardcode color values; prefer tokenized Tailwind classes
- Ensure sufficient color contrast and accessible states

## Component Styling

- Prefer utility classes over custom CSS; avoid writing new CSS
- Group related utilities with `@apply` sparingly for readability
- Use responsive utilities mobile-first
- Implement proper state variants (hover, focus, active, disabled)
- Keep component styles consistent and accessible

## Layout

- Use Flexbox and Grid effectively
- Apply a consistent spacing system
- Use container queries when applicable
- Apply proper padding, margin, and alignment utilities

## Typography

- Use proper font size and line-height utilities
- Configure custom fonts if needed
- Use appropriate text alignment and decoration utilities

## Components & Animations

- Prefer shadcn/ui primitives when available
- Keep variants consistent; use transition and animation utilities thoughtfully

## Responsive Design

- Build mobile-first; scale up with breakpoints
- Use responsive typography and spacing utilities

## Performance

- Keep purge content accurate to minimize CSS size
- Minimize custom CSS; prefer utilities
- Monitor bundle size in production
